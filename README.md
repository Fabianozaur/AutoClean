# AutoClean

The AutoClean Web Application is the application I developed during my last semester in the Univeristy for the Batchelor Thesis.

It works as a Wolt combined with an Uber as an web application in which the users can order a car washing service. The users need to create an account first 
after that they can see the main page where they can pin point the location of their car, in order to create the car wash request, they can also select to which washing station they want their car to be washed. On the other side of the application the washer users can see the order being placed and so they can choose which order they prefer. After the washer selects the other user's order, they become connected and they can see on the map each others locations, after the washer comes and picks up the car the client will be able to see the live tracking of his car live anytime. 

You can watch a full Demo of the application on this link: https://youtu.be/70puifbrcT8
